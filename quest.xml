To either side, wide stairs lead upwards.Doors to the east and west lead into the academy chambers, whilst the main entrance is to the south, a huge arched gateway, beyond which you can see the countryside; a lake and mountains beyond.]]></description>

To the south is the lower courtyard, and arranged around the three sides are the chambers of the academy, and behind them, the towers of power.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[The most striking feature of this room is the giant phallus in the centre of the room. For a moment you wonder if it is a statue, then it twitches a bit, and suddenly it is spirting... well, cum, presumably, into the air. Dragging your eyes off the monstrous cock, the room is octagonal, with a high wooden, roof. The only exit is back north; the other seven walls are hung with tapestries depicting men and woman - or satyrs and nymphs - in various sexual positions.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[The Hall of Nature seems to be a place for students to meet and socialise. A large planter in the middle has an impressive variety of flowers and shrubs, none of which you recognise. The pink flowers are especially impressive. There are smaller planters in each corner, with wooden seats incorporated into the design. A door south leads to the Great Hall, and to the north to the lecture theatre, or you can go west, into the courtyard.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Not quite what you're used to back home, the dormitory is a single room, with perhaps a dozen double bunk beds down each side. The beds are very plain, with white sheets; each looks neatly made. There is a small chest on either side of each one, and windows between each bed, to the west, looking out onto a wide valley and to the east, overlooking the lower courtyard. The main door is north, but there is a small door in the southeast corner that leads on to the battlements.]]></description>

From here you can look down on the courtyards, to watch the waters spray from the fountain in the upper pool, then cascade down into the lower pool. Looking south, you can see the road down to the town, and beyond that a tranquil lake, surrounded by imposing mountains.]]></description>

Manacles are attached at four points. The walls are covered in runes, some huge, some tiny, painted in black on the dark grey of the stone. You keep thinking you see them move out of the corner of your eye.]]></description>
